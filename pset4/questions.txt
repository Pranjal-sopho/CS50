0.  A  BMP supports 32 bit or 4 billion (2^32) colors
    GIF's support 8 bit or 256 (2^8) colors
    LPEG's support 24 bit or 16 million(2^24) colors
    PNG also supports 24 bit or 16 million colors (since each bit can be either 0 or 1) 
1.  GIF's support animation
2.  Some amount of data is lost in lossy compression due to which the decompressed file(image)
    has a lower quality since the file cannot be completely decompressed or recovered anymore 
    whereas lossless compression uses algorithms to make sure that the data can be fully recovered.
3.  JPEG
4.  the system modifies the filename’s first
    character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted while the actual file is left untouched.
5.  TODO

6.  stdint.h is a header file that declares specified integer types as having a certain width.

7.  uint8_t stands for an unsigned inteher which is 8 bits long, similarly uint32_t stands for an integer 32 bits long, 
    int32_t for a signed integer 32 bits long and uint16_t for an unsigned integer 16 bits long. 
    They basically are used to shoew how we intend to use our data.

8.  BYTE = 1 byte
	DWORD = 4 bytes
	LONG = 4 bytes
	WORD = 2 bytes

9.  The first 2 bytes of a BMP file must be the words 'BM' of bftype which is the bitmap signature

10.bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file whereas
   biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes. 

11.A negative biheight indicates that our bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap) 
   and its origin is the upper left corner.

12.biBitCount 

13. fopen might return null if the output file cant be opened to write to or there may not enough space
    in memory to create a file.

14. Because the third argument is the number of units to be read and we want to read only 1
    unit of data at a time (which may contain more than 1 byte ).

15. 3 since padding = 4 - 3*3

16. The functon fseek takes the pointer from its current position in the file and moves it by
    specified number of bytes.

17. SEEK_CUR is a constant giving the current position of the file pointer from where the offset is added.

18. David Malan, maybe.
